
To compile and install SDL2-bbb-sgx:

    1.  GNU/Linux on the BeagleBone Black WITHOUT cross-compilation:
        * Download the official 2020-04-06 compressed image of Debian 10 for the BeagleBone Black from beagleboard.org: https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-10.3-iot-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz
        * Follow the directions in the BeagleBoard Getting Started Guide to flash the image to the BeagleBone Black and initialize a network connection. https://beagleboard.org/getting-started
        * An HDMI monitor and male Micro HDMI to male HDMI cable are required to view SDL demos and applications. Connect these to the BBB.
        * Either connect a USB keyboard or use ssh to log in to the BBB and launch a shell.
        * Obtain an internet connection by connecting over ethernet, sharing your workstation's connection over USB, or installing a wireless network adapter and connecting to a wireless network.
        * Configure your preferred DNS address using 'sudo echo 'nameserver 1.1.1.1' | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf'
        * Update the system and install git using 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install git'
        * Clone this repository and enter the directory using 'git clone https://github.com/robertkirkman/SDL2-bbb-sgx.git && cd SDL2-bbb-sgx'
        ***** WARNING: The following step will downgrade your system to kernel 4.14 and create a FrankenDebian. The graphics driver is unmaintained - if you know a better solution that works, for example if you know how to use openpvrsgx (https://github.com/openpvrsgx-devgroup/linux_openpvrsgx), please contact me on Discord at magi#5813.
        * Install the graphics driver binaries for the IT PowerVR SGX530 from rcn-ee.com, the official beagleboard repository, by running the installation script as root: 'sudo ./install-sgx.sh'. This might take a long time. The system will reboot when it is complete.
        *****
        * Launch a shell on the BBB and change directory to the repository again using 'cd SDL2-bbb-sgx'.
        * Create a build directory using 'mkdir build && cd build'.
        * Run 'CFLAGS="-O3 -march=armv7-a -marm -mfpu=neon -mtune=cortex-a8" ../configure --enable-video-kmsdrm --disable-video-vulkan --disable-video-opengl --enable-video-opengles --disable-video-opengles1 --enable-video-opengles2 --disable-video-dummy --disable-video-x11 --disable-kmsdrm-shared; make; sudo make install'
        
        GNU/Linux on the BeagleBone Black WITH cross-compilation:
        * TODO

    2.  Look at the example programs in ./test, and check out the online
        documentation at https://wiki.libsdl.org/

    3.  Join the SDL developer mailing list by sending E-mail to
